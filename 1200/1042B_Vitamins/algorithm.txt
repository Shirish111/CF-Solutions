Even though the combinations are several, but the set of
outcomes are few( i.e. 7).

Let's denote the juice in its binary representation
(eg A => 0th index, B => 1st index, C => 2nd index)

eg
AB => 011
A => 001
C => 100

Now, the number of possible outcomes by combining the values is 7,
i.e. from 001 to 111

Let's have the empty vitamin case as 000

Array a = [0 M M M M M M M]
           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

For every number, loop through 0 to 8 and do |index|

if a[bin | index] != M
then
	a[bin | index] = min(a[bin | index], a[index] + cost)
end if
end loop

When index = 0, the if condition will evaluate for single juice
When index > 0, the if condition will check for the
min(element at OR of two indices, sum (a[index] + cost of current element))
